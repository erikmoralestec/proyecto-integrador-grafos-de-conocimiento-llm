Objetivo general\n","\n","Esta etapa tuvo como finalidad **integrar el dataset de investigaciones de defectos (Investigations) del NHTSA-ODI** en una base de grafos (Neo4j AuraDB) para su posterior análisis relacional y semántico.  \n","El proceso buscó preservar la trazabilidad de los expedientes, garantizar la consistencia tipológica con las entidades ya integradas (*Recalls* y *Complaints*) y habilitar consultas complejas sobre relaciones técnicas y temporales.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 2. Contexto y preprocesamiento previo\n","\n","El conjunto de datos original (`FLAT_INV.zip`) fue previamente depurado y estandarizado mediante un pipeline reproducible en Colab:\n","\n","- Se forzaron los encabezados oficiales conforme al diccionario `INV.txt`.\n","- Se normalizaron fechas (`ODATE`, `CDATE`) y años (`YEAR`).\n","- Se limpiaron descripciones textuales (`SUBJECT`, `SUMMARY`, `COMPNAME`).\n","- Se derivaron columnas jerárquicas `COMP_L1`–`COMP_L5` a partir de la descomposición de `COMPNAME`.\n","- Se generaron exportaciones intermedias en formato `Parquet`, `JSONL` y `CSV` normalizado (`investigations_neo4j_ready.csv`).\n","\n","El CSV final contenía las columnas esenciales para la ingesta de grafo:\n","```\n","\n","[action_no, make, model, year, comp_l1, comp_l2, comp_l3, comp_l4, comp_l5, subject, summary, campaign_no]\n","\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 3. Diseño del modelo de grafo\n","\n","El modelo de datos en Neo4j se diseñó para capturar las relaciones entre **investigaciones**, **vehículos**, **componentes**, **fabricantes** y **campañas de retiro**.  \n","Cada investigación se representa como un nodo `(:Investigation)` conectado mediante relaciones semánticas y jerárquicas:\n","\n","- **Jerarquía de componentes** (`:Component`)\n","```\n","\n","(Component:L5) -[:SUB_OF]-> (Component:L4) -[:SUB_OF]-> (Component:L3) ...\n","\n","````\n","Se aplica de forma dinámica según los niveles disponibles (`COMP_L1–L5`).\n","\n","- **Relaciones explícitas:**\n","- `(Investigation)-[:MENTIONS]->(Component)`\n","- `(Investigation)-[:OF_MAKE]->(Make)`\n","- `(Investigation)-[:OF_MODEL]->(Model)`\n","- `(Investigation)-[:RELATES_TO]->(Recall)` (vínculo directo cuando existe `CAMPNO`)\n","\n","Este modelo es **isomorfo al utilizado para *Recalls***, garantizando interoperabilidad entre datasets.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 4. Lógica de ingesta (Cypher)\n","\n","El script `CYPHER_UPSERT_INV` se ejecutó desde Python con `neo4j` y realiza la carga **por lotes (batch 1000)** con transacciones idempotentes.  \n","Cada bloque `MERGE` asegura que no se dupliquen nodos ni relaciones:\n","\n","#### a. Creación de nodos principales\n","```cypher\n","MERGE (i:Investigation {id: row.action_no})\n","SET i.subject = coalesce(row.subject,''),\n","    i.summary = coalesce(row.summary,''),\n","    i.year = CASE WHEN row.year='' THEN NULL ELSE toInteger(row.year) END\n","````\n","\n","#### b. Creación condicional de Make/Model\n","\n","```cypher\n","FOREACH (_ IN CASE WHEN row.make <> '' THEN [1] ELSE [] END |\n","  MERGE (mk:Make {name: row.make})\n","  MERGE (i)-[:OF_MAKE]->(mk)\n",")\n","```\n","\n","#### c. Jerarquía de componentes (sin `WITH` ni `MATCH` dentro de `FOREACH`)\n","\n","Cada nivel se crea condicionalmente mediante `CASE`, garantizando compatibilidad con AuraDB:\n","\n","```cypher\n","MERGE (c1:Component {name: row.comp_l1})\n","MERGE (c2:Component {name: CASE WHEN row.comp_l2 <> '' THEN row.comp_l2 ELSE row.comp_l1 END})\n","FOREACH (_ IN CASE WHEN row.comp_l2 <> '' THEN [1] ELSE [] END |\n","  MERGE (c1)<-[:SUB_OF]-(c2)\n",")\n","...\n","MERGE (i)-[:MENTIONS]->(leaf)\n","```\n","\n","#### d. Asociación con campañas de retiro\n","\n","El vínculo con `Recall` se ejecuta **fuera de `FOREACH`**, cumpliendo las restricciones de Aura:\n","\n","```cypher\n","WITH row, i\n","WHERE row.campaign_no <> ''\n","OPTIONAL MATCH (r:Recall {id: row.campaign_no})\n","WITH i, r\n","WHERE r IS NOT NULL\n","MERGE (i)-[:RELATES_TO]->(r);\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 5. Resultados de ejecución\n","\n","* **Total de registros procesados:** 14 340 investigaciones\n","* **Nodos creados:**\n","\n","  * 14 340 `(:Investigation)`\n","  * ≈ 500 `(:Component)` (jerarquía deduplicada)\n","  * Marcas y modelos detectados automáticamente\n","* **Relaciones generadas:**\n","\n","  * `MENTIONS` (investigación → componente)\n","  * `OF_MAKE`, `OF_MODEL`\n","  * `SUB_OF` (jerarquía entre componentes)\n","  * `RELATES_TO` (vínculo con *Recall*)\n","\n","La ingesta completa se realizó sin errores sintácticos, validando que el esquema cumple con las restricciones de AuraDB (sin `WITH` ni `MATCH` dentro de `FOREACH`).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 6. Validación post-ingesta\n","\n","Verificaciones Cypher básicas en AuraDB:\n","\n","```cypher\n","// Conteo de entidades\n","MATCH (i:Investigation)-[:MENTIONS]->(c:Component)\n","RETURN count(i) AS investigations, count(DISTINCT c) AS components;\n","\n","// Inspección de jerarquías\n","MATCH (i:Investigation)-[:MENTIONS]->(leaf:Component)\n","OPTIONAL MATCH path=(leaf)-[:SUB_OF*0..4]->(root:Component)\n","RETURN i.id, leaf.name, [n IN nodes(path) | n.name] AS hierarchy\n","LIMIT 5;\n","```\n","\n","Ambas consultas confirmaron la correcta materialización de los nodos y las jerarquías de componentes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 7.

HOWEVER, IN 99% OF THE INCIDENTS REPORTED, THE VEHICLE DID NOT STALL.IN THE VERY FEW INCIDENTS WHERE THE VEHICLE DID STALL, MOST VEHICLES COULD BE RESTARTED.(4) ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPLAINANTS CITED THAT THEY SMELLED GAS OR A SLIGHT BURNING SMELL WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.(5) IN ALL BUT A VERY FEW INCIDENTS, VEHICLE DAMAGE WAS LIMITED TO THE ENGINE.IN ONE INCIDENT, THE COMPLAINT REPORTED THAT THE FUEL RAIL WAS DAMAGED AND REPLACED AFTER ONE OF THE SPARK PLUGS EJECTED FROM THE ENGINE; HOWEVER, THE COMPLAINANT REPORTED THAT THE DAMAGE DID NOT RESULT IN ANY TYPE OF FUEL LEAK OR FIRE.IN ANOTHER INCIDENT, THE ONLY INCIDENT WHERE A FIRE WAS ALLEGED, THE COMPLAINANT REPORTED THAT NO FLUID LEAK WAS OBSERVED, BUT THAT A FIRE RESULTED AFTER THE SPARK PLUG HAD EJECTED FROM THE ENGINE AND HE HAD RESTARTED THE VEHICLE AND DRIVEN TO ANOTHER LOCATION.NONE OF THE COMPLAINANTS REPORTED ANY DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE HOOD.(6) ONLY TWO COMPLAINANTS REPORTED THAT THEY OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE SOME DROPS OF FUEL COMING FROM THE CYLINDER WHERE THE SPARK PLUG HAD FAILED OR ON THE SPARK PLUG ITSELF; HOWEVER, EACH OF THESE COMPLAINANTS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO SMOKE OR FLAMES AS A RESULT OF HIS INCIDENT.AS THE PETITIONER NOTED, AND ODI?S ANALYSIS SHOWED, IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A SPARK PLUG TO DETACH FROM THE ENGINE CYLINDER THREADS IN THE SUBJECT VEHICLES.HOWEVER, ODI?S ANALYSIS OF 474 COMPLAINTS DESCRIBING SUCH INCIDENTS FOUND ONLY A VERY FEW ALLEGED ANY SAFETY-RELATED CONSEQUENCES.NONE OF THESE SHOWED ANY EVIDENCE OF A SERIOUS SAFETY CONSEQUENCE.GIVEN THE LARGE POPULATION AND RELATIVELY LONG EXPOSURE TIME OF THE SUBJECT VEHICLES, THE COMPLAINT ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE RISK TO MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY FROM THE ALLEGED DEFECT IS VERY LOW.IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT NHTSA WOULD ISSUE AN ORDER FOR THE NOTIFICATION AND REMEDY OF THE ALLEGED DEFECT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INVESTIGATION REQUESTED IN THE PETITION.THEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE NEED TO ALLOCATE AND PRIORITIZE NHTSA?S LIMITED RESOURCES TO BEST ACCOMPLISH THE AGENCY?S SAFETY MISSION, THE PETITION IS DENIED.\",\n          \"ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2017, DIONO LLC (DIONO) SUBMITTED A PART 573 RECALL REPORT TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (NHTSA) DESCRIBING VARIOUS NONCOMPLIANCES WITH FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARD (FMVSS) NO. 213 IN 519,052 CHILD RESTRAINTS MANUFACTURED BY DIONO (NHTSA RECALL NO. 17C-003). ON JULY 19, 2018, NHTSA OPENED AUDIT QUERY (AQ) 18-003 TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND EVALUATE DIONO'S COMPLIANCE WITH ITS SAFETY ACT OBLIGATIONS. ON JULY 20, 2018, NHTSA SENT AN INFORMATION REQUEST (IR) LETTER TO DIONO REQUESTING INFORMATION AS PART OF ITS AQ18-003 INVESTIGATION.NHTSA'S INQUIRY LED IT TO DETERMINE THAT DIONO HAD VIOLATED SEVERAL PROVISIONS OF THE SAFETY ACT, AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. DIONO DID NOT DISPUTE THAT CERTAIN VIOLATIONS DID OCCUR. RATHER, DIONO ASSERTED THAT THE PRINCIPAL VIOLATIONS WERE COMMITTED BY PAST EMPLOYEES AND PRIOR OWNERSHIP. DIONO REPRESENTED THAT A NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) FORMALLY JOINED DIONO IN NOVEMBER 2017, AND THAT SINCE THAT TIME, THE ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN OVERHAULED AND NEW POLICIES AND PROCESSES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE. NHTSA AND DIONO ENTERED INTO A CONSENT ORDER ON JANUARY 19, 2021, TO RESOLVE AQ18-003. AS PART OF THE CONSENT ORDER, DIONO AGREED TO PAY A CIVIL PENALTY OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($120,000) AND AGREED THAT AN ADDITIONAL CIVIL PENALTY OF THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($380,000) (ABEYANCE AMOUNT) WOULD BE DEFERRED AND HELD IN ABEYANCE PENDING DIONO'S SATISFACTORY COMPLETION OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS CONSENT ORDER. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE SAFETY ACT OR TERMS OF THE CONSENT ORDER MAY RESULT IN THE ABEYANCE AMOUNT OR PORTIONS THEREOF COMING DUE.IN THE CONSENT ORDER, DIONO ALSO AGREED TO SEVERAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. DIONO IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A CONSULTANT ADVISE AND ASSIST DIONO TO DEVELOP A TRAINING PLAN AND TO TRAIN DIONO EMPLOYEES ON TOPICS SUCH AS THE SAFETY ACT AND REGULATIONS. THE CONSULTANT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF DIONO'S COMPLIANCE WITH THE SAFETY ACT AND REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. DIONO IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO NHTSA A WRITTEN REPORT FROM ITS CONSULTANT DETAILING THE FACTUAL FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDIT.DIONO IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A DETAILED STATEMENT TO NHTSA REGARDING ANY NEW OR REVISED PROCEDURES THAT ADDRESS THE RESULT OF THE AUDIT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CONSULTANT. DIONO HAS AGREED TO REPURCHASE OR REPLACE SEATS RECALLED UNDER NHTSA RECALL NO. 17C-003, FOR THOSE OWNERS WHO NEED TO USE THE SEAT IN A HARNESS MODE FOR CHILDREN OVER SIXTY-FIVE (65) POUNDS WITH A LAP BELT ONLY AND WHO DO NOT HAVE A TETHER ANCHORAGE AVAILABLE, UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. DIONO ALSO AGREED TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS TO NHTSA RELATING TO ITS EARLY WARNING REPORTING, BY PROVIDING A STATEMENT TO NHTSA'S TRENDS ANALYSIS DIVISION (TAD) IF IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY INFORMATION TO REPORT FOR THAT QUARTER. THE CONSENT ORDER ALSO REQUIRES DIONO AND ITS CONSULTANT TO HAVE QUARTERLY MEETINGS TO DISCUSS THE ACTIONS DIONO HAS TAKEN TO SATISFY THE TERMS OF THE CONSENT ORDER.BASED ON THE CONSENT ORDER, THIS AUDIT QUERY INVESTIGATION, AQ18-003, IS CLOSED. CLOSURE OF THIS AQ HAS NO BEARING ON THE TERMS OF THE CONSENT ORDER, INCLUDING DIONO'S ONGOING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS OR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A DETERMINATION BY NHTSA AS TO DIONO'S PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONSENT ORDER TO DATE.\",\n          \"RMD IDENTIFIED SEVERAL HID REPLACEMENT LIGHTING RECALL CAMPAIGNS THAT APPEARED NOT TO HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED OR CONDUCTED IMPROPERLY.THE RECALL CAMPAIGNS AND MANUFACTURERS SUBJECT TO THIS INVESTIGATION WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE OPENING RESUME.RMD ISSUED INFORMATION REQUEST LETTERS TO EACH MANUFACTURER INQUIRING INTO THE STATUS OF EACH RECALL AND REQUESTING DOCUMENTATION WHERE NEEDED.WHERE THOSE LETTERS WERE EITHER RETURNED UNDELIVERED, OR A RESPONSE WAS NOT FORTHCOMING, NHTSA ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT EACH MANUFACTURER BY PHONE OR BY MAILING TO ALTERNATIVE ADDRESSES.WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THREE RECALL CAMPAIGNS, RMD WAS SUCCESSFUL IN CONTACTING THE MANUFACTURER, CONFIRMING THE STATUS OF A RECALL CAMPAIGN, COLLECTING MISSING OR CORRECTED RECALL DOCUMENTATION AND, WHERE NECESSARY, HAVING THE MANUFACTURER INITIATE ITS OWNER NOTIFICATION PROGRAM.
